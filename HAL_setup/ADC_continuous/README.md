# ADC HAL driver task (continuous)

All about configuration and working with continuous mode is inside main  
For you tasks:
1) Add code for conversion sending (serial) and send by serial readed data
Device to read may be potentiometer, for example =)
2) Read and send by serial temperature sensor data, try to warm it with your hand
3) Draw plot of potentiometer potition in MATLAB
4) Try linear mode with starting conversion in the interrupt (there is I-class functions)
5) Check out synchronous conversion, verify that it is not async (handling CPU)
